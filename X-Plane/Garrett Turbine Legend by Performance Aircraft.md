## Garrett Turbine Legend by Performance Aircraft ##

Surfing Youtube some time ago, I discovered the Garrett Legend. It was love at first sight! What a beautiful little aircraft - part P-51 and part general aviation craft! So I searched X-Plane.org to see if anyone else had been so similarly enamored as to have build it. Well - someone had - @olav , but his work of the flight model nearly complete, he hoped for more fidelity in flight behavior still. He hung up the work and offered a beta version for the community for the time being.

In contacting him to comment on his excellent flight model work . . . more complete and researched than any I had done for my own creations,he offered that I could add the aesthetics it needed if I wished. I was delighted to try to equal his hard labors and a collaboration was born

We are now at a point to post our efforts for the community - the Garrett Turbine Legend by Performance Aircraft.

The plane itself, a Kit Plane, has evolved through various configurations from the first to fly - with an adapted Chevy V8 piston (575 shp) version and then a Turbine version with a Walter 601 (724 shp) through to the latest incarnation with a Garrett TPE331-10 turbine (1110 shp). There is even reportedly a military version marketed by Venom Military Aircraft.

We will soon be posting the combined @olav 's flight model and @datadave 's Blender modeling to X-Plane.com to download as freeware (creative commons, non-commercial). Watch for it.
