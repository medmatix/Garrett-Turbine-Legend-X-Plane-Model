# Garrett Turbine Legend by Performance Aircraft ##

by @olav and @datayork

The Performance Legend is a Kit Plane which has evolved through various configurations from the first to fly - with an adapted Chevy V8 piston (575 shp) version and then a Turbine version with a Walter 601 (724 shp) through to the latest incarnation with a Garrett TPE331-10 turbine (1110 shp). There is even reportedly a military version marketed by Venom Military Aircraft.

Produced for X-Plane (11 and 12) from a collaboration involving @olav 's flight model and @datadave 's Blender modeling aesthetics is posted to download as freeware (creative commons, non-commercial). The performance should approach the characteristics of the Garrett powered version.
