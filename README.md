# Garrett Turbine Legend X-Plane Model
 An collaborative project designing and modeling the Performance Legend aircraft for X-plane simulator 

The project subsumes a flight model by olav (@olav on X-plane.org) and an external set of Blender based objects (obj8 format) for addition to the X-Plane, Plane Maker definition of the Legend.

In addition a static set of Blender models and a 3D printable model are included in the project based on the objects developed from Blender originals.

The flyable X-Plane versions for XP11 and XP12 both, are available on [X-Plane.org](tbd).

The static and printable models are available to my subscribing supporters on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/medmatix).

A lot or prep and research work on all my projects is freely available here in my Github repositories.
